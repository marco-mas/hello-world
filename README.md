# hello-world
Just to start with GitHub.
I modify this file a bit (by adding this).
I think it could be a good idea to add this: 1, 2, 3, 4.
... what about adding this as well?
In line 2, I have removed "get started" and I have added "start" (2-Feb-2019 22:13)
Why not also adding this line?
This is what I would like it to be.
